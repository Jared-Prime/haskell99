Today's goal is to get started with some basic tools, resources, and a simple trick to get a bit comfortable on the interactive environment.

1. tools:
  - [Kitematic](https://kitematic.com/) for managing Docker containers on MacOS
  - [official haskell container](https://hub.docker.com/_/haskell/)
  - [Haskell for Mac](http://haskellformac.com/) (costs $) IDE with interactive playground
2. resources:
  - [H-99: Ninety-Nine Haskell Problems](https://wiki.haskell.org/99_questions) small problems to teach the language
  - [Learn You A Haskell](http://learnyouahaskell.com/chapters) popular book
3. tricks:
  - in GHCi, type `:info <function>` to get the type signature for a function

Future sessions will follow this format, plus the addition of a fourth "solutions" item to share solutions to the day's problem from H-99.
