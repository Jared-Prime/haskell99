1. tools:
  - another installation is the [official platform](https://www.haskell.org/platform/)
  - once you have a working installation, the program `ghci` launches the interactive repl

2. resources:
  - no new ones today

3. tricks / techniques:
  - the solution below follows the standard sourcefile construction of Haskell code. but we can define functions "on the fly" by using the `let { }` constructor

4. solutions:
- as a sourcefile:

<!-- the markdown engine is not handling the Haskell code well -->
<pre><code>myLast :: [a] -> a
myLast []     = error "empty list"
myLast [x]    = x
myLast (_:xs) = myLast xs</code></pre>

- dynamically in GHCi:

<pre><code>let {
  myLast2 []     = error "empty list"
  myLast2 [x]    = x
  myLast2 (_:xs) = myLast2 xs
}</code></pre>
So the main (casual) observation is that a function has two components: the type declaration and the function implementation. When writing source code, the type declaration is best practice but is not required. In general the compiler will attempt to infer the type signature from its definition. The function implementation mechanically works via pattern matching -- a very powerful concept that we'll eventually get around to learning in depth. Otherwise, a good first exercise!
